						<p style="color: black;">I am so proud of you for everything you accomplished this year,
						and I hope you have an amazing time at the National Ballet. Not many 11
						year olds can get into such a program, let alone have the courage to
						move away from home and into residence so early on.
						<br><br>
						This is your website, you can choose to do whatever you want with it,
						and eventually, you may even want to add your own content. 
						In the meantime, you are now able to create your own personalized
						email, in the format _____@ellisgallant.com. Just come talk to me when
						you want to set this up and we can do it together.
						<br><br>
						I hope you have an absolutely incredible birthday.
						<br><br>
						Much Love,<br>
						Brother</p>
